	 ('A standard, requirement, or implementation specification adopted under this subchapter that is contrary to a provision of State law preempts the provision of State law. This general rule applies, except if one or more of the following conditions is met: (a) A determination is made by the Secretary under § 160.204 that the provision of State law: (1) Is necessary: (i) To prevent fraud and abuse related to the provision of or payment for health care; (ii) To ensure appropriate State regulation of insurance and health plans to the extent expressly authorized by statute or regulation; (iii) For State reporting on health care delivery or costs; or (iv) For purposes of serving a compelling need related to public health, safety, or welfare, and, if a standard, requirement, or implementation specification under part 164 of this subchapter is at issue, if the Secretary determines that the intrusion into privacy is warranted when balanced against the need to be served; or (2) Has as its principal purpose the regulation of the manufacture, registration, distribution, dispensing, or other control of any controlled substances (as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802), or that is deemed a controlled substance by State law. (b) The provision of State law relates to the privacy of individually identifiable health information and is more stringent than a standard, requirement, or implementation specification adopted under subpart E of part 164 of this subchapter. (c) The provision of State law, including State procedures established under such law, as applicable, provides for the reporting of disease or injury, child abuse, birth, or death, or for the conduct of public health surveillance, investigation, or intervention.

	 ('(a) The Secretary may issue subpoenas in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 405(d) and (e), 1320a- 7a(j), and 1320d-5 to require the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of any other evidence during an investigation or compliance review pursuant to this part. For purposes of this paragraph, a person other than a natural person is termed an “entity.” (1) A subpoena issued under this paragraph must— (i) State the name of the person (including the entity, if applicable) to whom the subpoena is addressed; (ii) State the statutory authority for the subpoena; (iii) Indicate the date, time, and place that the testimony will take place; (iv) Include a reasonably specific description of any docu ments or items required to be produced; and (v) If the subpoena is addressed to an entity, describe with reasonable particularity the subject matter on which testimony is required. In that event, the entity must designate one or more natural persons who will testify on its behalf, and must state as to each such person that person''s name and address and the matters on which he or she will testify. The designated person must testify as to matters known or reasonably available to the entity. (2) A subpoena under this section must be served by— (i) Delivering a copy to the natural person named in the subpoena or to the entity named in the subpoena at its last principal place of business; or (ii) Registered or certified mail addressed to the natural person at his or her last known dwelling place or to the entity at its last known principal place of business. (3) A verified return by the natural person serving the subpoena setting forth the manner of service or, in the case of service by registered or certified mail, the signed return post office receipt, constitutes proof of service. (4) Witnesses are entitled to the same fees and mileage as witnesses in the district courts of the United States (28 U.S.C. 1821 and 1825). Fees need not be paid at the time the subpoena is served. (5) A subpoena under this section is enforceable through the district court of the United States for the district where the subpoenaed natural person resides or is found or where the entity transacts business. (b) Investigational inquiries are non-public investigational proceedings conducted by the Secretary. (1) Testimony at investigational inquiries will be taken under oath or affirmation. (2) Attendance of non-witnesses is discretionary with the Secretary, except that a witness is entitled to be accompanied, represented, and advised by an attorney. (3) Representatives of the Secretary are entitled to attend and ask questions. (4) A witness will have the opportunity to clarify his or her answers on the record following questioning by the Secretary. (5) Any claim of privilege must be asserted by the witness on the record. (6) Objections must be asserted on the record. Errors of any kind that might be corrected if promptly presented will be deemed to be waived unless reasonable objection is made at the investigational inquiry. Except where the objection is on the grounds of privilege, the question will be answered on the record, subject to objection. (7) If a witness refuses to answer any question not privileged or to produce requested documents or items, or engages in conduct likely to delay or obstruct the investigational inquiry, the Secretary may seek enforcement of the subpoena under paragraph (a)(5) of this section. (8) The proceedings will be recorded and transcribed. The witness is entitled to a copy of the transcript, upon payment of prescribed costs, except that, for good cause, the witness may be limited to inspection of the official transcript of his or her testimony. (9)(i) The transcript will be submitted to the witness for signature. (A) Where the witness will be provided a copy of the transcript, the transcript will be submitted to the witness for signature. The witness may submit to the Secretary written proposed corrections to the transcript, with such corrections attached to the transcript. If the witness does not return a signed copy of the transcript or proposed corrections within 30 days (computed in the same manner as prescribed under § 160.526 of this part) of its being submitted to him or her for signature, the witness will be deemed to have agreed that the transcript is true and accurate. (B) Where, as provided in paragraph (b)(8) of this section, the witness is limited to inspecting the transcript, the witness will have the opportunity at the time of inspection to propose corrections to the transcript, with corrections attached to the transcript. The witness will also have the opportunity to sign the transcript. If the witness does not sign the transcript or offer corrections within 30 days (computed in the same manner as prescribed under § 160.526 of this part) of receipt of notice of the opportunity to inspect the transcript, the witness will be deemed to have agreed that the transcript is true and accurate. (ii) The Secretary''s proposed corrections to the record of transcript will be attached to the transcript.

	 ('As used in this subpart, the following terms have the following meanings: Reasonable cause means an act or omission in which a covered entity or business associate knew, or by exercising reasonable diligence would have known, that the act or omission violated an administrative simplification provision, but in which the covered entity or business associate did not act with willful neglect. Reasonable diligence means the business care and prudence expected from a person seeking to satisfy a legal requirement under similar circumstances.

If the respondent has no knowledge of a particular finding of fact and so states, the finding shall be deemed denied. The request for a hearing must also state the circumstances or arguments that the respondent alleges constitute the grounds for any defense and the factual and legal basis for opposing the penalty, except that a respondent may raise an affirmative defense under § 160.410(b)(1) at any time.

	 ('(a) A party may make a request to another party for production of documents for inspection and copying that are relevant and material to the issues before the ALJ. (b) For the purpose of this section, the term “documents” includes information, reports, answers, records, accounts, papers and other data and documentary evidence. Nothing contained in this section may be interpreted to require the creation of a document, except that requested data stored in an electronic data storage system must be produced in a form accessible to the requesting party. (c) Requests for documents, requests for admissions, written interrogatories, depositions and any forms of discovery, other than those permitted under paragraph (a) of this section, are not authorized. (d) This section may not be construed to require the disclosure of interview reports or statements obtained by any party, or on behalf of any party, of persons who will not be called as witnesses by that party, or analyses and summaries prepared in conjunction with the investigation or litigation of the case, or any otherwise privileged documents. (e)(1) When a request for production of documents has been received, within 30 days the party receiving that request must either fully respond to the request, or state that the request is being objected to and the reasons for that objection. If objection is made to part of an item or category, the part must be specified. Upon receiving any objections, the party seeking production may then, within 30 days or any other time frame set by the ALJ, file a motion for an order compelling discovery. The party receiving a request for production may also file a motion for protective order any time before the date the production is due. (2) The ALJ may grant a motion for protective order or deny a motion for an order compelling discovery if the ALJ finds that the discovery sought— (i) Is irrelevant; (ii) Is unduly costly or burdensome; (iii) Will unduly delay the proceeding; or (iv) Seeks privileged information.

	 ('(a) In meeting the burden of proof set forth in § 160.534, the Secretary may introduce the results of a statistical sampling study as evidence of the number of violations under § 160.406 of this part, or the factors considered in determining the amount of the civil money penalty under § 160.408 of this part. Such statistical sampling study, if based upon an appropriate sampling and computed by valid statistical methods, constitutes prima facie evidence of the number of violations and the existence of factors material to the proposed civil money penalty as described in §§ 160.406 and 160.408. (b) Once the Secretary has made a prima facie case, as described in paragraph (a) of this section, the burden of going forward shifts to the respondent to produce evidence reasonably calculated to rebut the findings of the statistical sampling study.

	 ('(a) The ALJ must determine the admissibility of evidence. (b) Except as provided in this subpart, the ALJ is not bound by the Federal Rules of Evidence. However, the ALJ may apply the Federal Rules of Evidence where appropriate, for example, to exclude unreliable evidence. (c) The ALJ must exclude irrelevant or immaterial evidence. (d) Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or by considerations of undue delay or needless presentation of cumulative evidence. (e) Although relevant, evidence must be excluded if it is privileged under Federal law. (f) Evidence concerning offers of compromise or settlement are inadmissible to the extent provided in Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. (g) Evidence of crimes, wrongs, or acts other than those at issue in the instant case is admissible in order to show motive, opportunity, intent, knowledge, preparation, identity, lack of mistake, or existence of a scheme. This evidence is admissible regardless of whether the crimes, wrongs, or acts occurred during the statute of limitations period applicable to the acts or omissions that constitute the basis for liability in the case and regardless of whether they were referenced in the Secretary''s notice of proposed determination under § 160.420 of this part. (h) The ALJ must permit the parties to introduce rebuttal witnesses and evidence.

	 ('(a) Any party may appeal the decision of the ALJ to the Board by filing a notice of appeal with the Board within 30 days of the date of service of the ALJ decision. The Board may extend the initial 30 day period for a period of time not to exceed 30 days if a party files with the Board a request for an extension within the initial 30 day period and shows good cause. (b) If a party files a timely notice of appeal with the Board, the ALJ must forward the record of the proceeding to the Board. (c) A notice of appeal must be accompanied by a written brief specifying exceptions to the initial decision and reasons supporting the exceptions. Any party may file a brief in opposition to the exceptions, which may raise any relevant issue not addressed in the exceptions, within 30 days of receiving the notice of appeal and the accompanying brief. The Board may permit the parties to file reply briefs. (d) There is no right to appear personally before the Board or to appeal to the Board any interlocutory ruling by the ALJ. (e) Except for an affirmative defense under § 160.410(a)(1) or (2) of this part, the Board may not consider any issue not raised in the parties'' briefs, nor any issue in the briefs that could have been raised before the ALJ but was not. (f) If any party demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Board that additional evidence not presented at such hearing is relevant and material and that there were reasonable grounds for the failure to adduce such evidence at the hearing, the Board may remand the matter to the ALJ for consideration of such additional evidence. (g) The Board may decline to review the case, or may affirm, increase, reduce, reverse or remand any penalty determined by the ALJ. (h) The standard of review on a disputed issue of fact is whether the initial decision of the ALJ is supported by substantial evidence on the whole record. The standard of review on a disputed issue of law is whether the decision is erroneous. (i) Within 60 days after the time for submission of briefs and reply briefs, if permitted, has expired, the Board must serve on each party to the appeal a copy of the Board''s decision and a statement describing the right of any respondent who is penalized to seek judicial review. (j)(1) The Board''s decision under paragraph (i) of this section, including a decision to decline review of the initial decision, becomes the final decision of the Secretary 60 days after the date of service of the Board''s decision, except with respect to a decision to remand to the ALJ or if reconsideration is requested under this paragraph. (2) The Board will reconsider its decision only if it determines that the decision contains a clear error of fact or error of law. New evidence will not be a basis for reconsideration unless the party demonstrates that the evidence is newly discovered and was not previously available. (3) A party may file a motion for reconsideration with the Board before the date the decision becomes final under paragraph (j)(1) of this section. A motion for reconsideration must be accompanied by a written brief specifying any alleged error of fact or law and, if the party is relying on additional evidence, explaining why the evidence was not previously available. Any party may file a brief in opposition within 15 days of receiving the motion for reconsideration and the accompanying brief unless this time limit is extended by the Board for good cause shown. Reply briefs are not permitted. (4) The Board must rule on the motion for reconsideration not later than 30 days from the date the opposition brief is due. If the Board denies the motion, the decision issued under paragraph (i) of this section becomes the final decision of the Secretary on the date of service of the ruling. If the Board grants the motion, the Board will issue a reconsidered decision, after such procedures as the Board determines necessary to address the effect of any error. The Board''s decision on reconsideration becomes the final decision of the Secretary on the date of service of the decision, except with respect to a decision to remand to the ALJ. (5) If service of a ruling or decision issued under this section is by mail, the date of service will be deemed to be 5 days from the date of mailing. (k)(1) A respondent''s petition for judicial review must be filed within 60 days of the date on which the decision of the Board becomes the final decision of the Secretary under paragraph (j) of this section. (2) In compliance with 28 U.S.C. 2112(a), a copy of any petition for judicial review filed in any U.S. Court of Appeals challenging the final decision of the Secretary must be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the General Counsel of HHS. The petition copy must be a copy showing that it has been time-stamped by the clerk of the court when the original was filed with the court.

(3) Disclose its NPI, when requested, to any entity that needs the NPI to identify that covered health care provider in a standard transaction. (4) Communicate to the NPS any changes in its required data elements in the NPS within 30 days of the change. (5) If it uses one or more business associates to conduct standard transactions on its behalf, require its business associate(s) to use its NPI and other NPIs appropriately as required by the transactions that the business associate(s) conducts on its behalf. (6) If it has been assigned NPIs for one or more subparts, comply with the requirements of paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(5) of this section with respect to each of those NPIs. (b) An organization covered health care provider that has as a member, employs, or contracts with, an individual health care provider who is not a covered entity and is a prescriber, must require such health care provider to— (1) Obtain an NPI from the National Plan and Provider Enumeration System (NPPES); and (2) To the extent the prescriber writes a prescription while acting within the scope of the prescriber''s relationship with the organization, disclose the NPI upon request to any entity that needs it to identify the prescriber in a standard transaction.

	 ('(a) General rules. (1) If an entity requests a health plan to conduct a transaction as a standard transaction, the health plan must do so. (2) A health plan may not delay or reject a transaction, or attempt to adversely affect the other entity or the transaction, because the transaction is a standard transaction. (3) A health plan may not reject a standard transaction on the basis that it contains data elements not needed or used by the health plan (for example, coordination of benefits information). (4) A health plan may not offer an incentive for a health care provider to conduct a transaction covered by this part as a transaction described under the exception provided for in § 162.923(b). (5) A health plan that operates as a health care clearinghouse, or requires an entity to use a health care clearinghouse to receive, process, or transmit a standard transaction may not charge fees or costs in excess of the fees or costs for normal telecommunications that the entity incurs when it directly transmits, or receives, a standard transaction to, or from, a health plan. (6) During the period from March 17, 2009 through December 31, 2011, a health plan may not delay or reject a standard transaction, or attempt to adversely affect the other entity or the transaction, on the basis that it does not comply with another adopted standard for the same period. (b) Coordination of benefits. If a health plan receives a standard transaction and coordinates benefits with another health plan (or another payer), it must store the coordination of benefits data it needs to forward the standard transaction to the other health plan (or other payer). (c) Code sets. A health plan must meet each of the following requirements: (1) Accept and promptly process any standard transaction that contains codes that are valid, as provided in subpart J of this part.

For each proposed modification, the organization must meet the following requirements: (1) Comparison to a current standard. Provide a detailed explanation, no more than 10 pages in length, of how the proposed modification would be a significant improvement to the current standard in terms of the following principles: (i) Improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the health care system by leading to cost reductions for, or improvements in benefits from, electronic health care transactions. (ii) Meet the needs of the health data standards user community, particularly health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses. (iii) Be uniform and consistent with the other standards adopted under this part and, as appropriate, with other private and public sector health data standards. (iv) Have low additional development and implementation costs relative to the benefits of using the standard. (v) Be supported by an ANSI- accredited SSO or other private or public organization that would maintain the standard over time. (vi) Have timely development, testing, implementation, and updating procedures to achieve administrative simplification benefits faster. (vii) Be technologically independent of the computer platforms and transmission protocols used in electronic health transactions, unless they are explicitly part of the standard. (viii) Be precise, unambiguous, and as simple as possible. (ix) Result in minimum data collection and paperwork burdens on users. (x) Incorporate flexibility to adapt more easily to changes in the health care infrastructure (such as new services, organizations, and provider types) and information technology. (2) Specifications for the proposed modification. Provide specifications for the proposed modification, including any additional system requirements. (3) Testing of the proposed modification. Provide an explanation, no more than 5 pages in length, of how the organization intends to test the standard, including the number and types of health plans and health care providers expected to be involved in the test, geographical areas, and beginning and ending dates of the test. (4) Trading partner concurrences. Provide written concurrences from trading partners who would agree to participate in the test. (b) Basis for granting an exception. The Secretary may grant an initial exception, for a period not to exceed 3 years, based on, but not limited to, the following criteria: (1) An assessment of whether the proposed modification demonstrates a significant improvement to the current standard. (2) The extent and length of time of the exception. (3) Consultations with DSMOs. (c) Secretary''s decision on exception. The Secretary makes a decision and notifies the organization requesting the exception whether the request is granted or denied. (1) Exception granted. If the Secretary grants an exception, the notification includes the following information: (i) The length of time for which the exception applies. (ii) The trading partners and geographical areas the Secretary approves for testing. (iii) Any other conditions for approving the exception. (2) Exception denied. If the Secretary does not grant an exception, the notification explains the reasons the Secretary considers the proposed modification would not be a significant improvement to the current standard and any other rationale for the denial. (d) Organization''s report on test results. Within 90 days after the test is completed, an organization that receives an exception must submit a report on the results of the test, including a cost-benefit analysis, to a location specified by the Secretary by notice in the FEDERAL REGISTER. (e) Extension allowed.

	 ('As used in this subpart, the following terms have the following meanings: Breach means the acquisition, access use, or disclosure of protected health information in a manner not permitted under subpart E of this part which compromises the security or privacy of the protected health information. (1) Breach excludes: (i) Any unintentional acquisition, access, or use of protected health information by a workforce member or person acting under the authority of a covered entity or a business associate, if such acquisition, access, or use was made in good faith and within the scope of authority and does not result in further use or disclosure in a manner not permitted under subpart E of this part. (ii) Any inadvertent disclosure by a person who is authorized to access protected health information at a covered entity or business associate to another person authorized to access protected health information at the same covered entity or business associate, or organized health care arrangement in which the covered entity participates, and the information received as a result of such disclosure is not further used or , disclosed in a manner not permitted under subpart E of this part. (iii) A disclosure of protected health information where a covered entity or business associate has a good faith belief that an unauthorized person to whom the disclosure was made would not reasonably have been able to retain such information. (2) Except as provided in paragraph (1) of this definition, an acquisition, access, use, or disclosure of protected health information in a manner not permitted under subpart E is presumed to be a breach unless the covered entity or business associate, as applicable, demonstrates that there is a low probability that the protected health information has been compromised based on a risk assessment of at least the following factors: (i) The nature and extent of the protected health information involved, including the types of identifiers and the likelihood of re- identification; (ii) The unauthorized person who used the protected health information or to whom the disclosure was made; (iii) Whether the protected health information was actually acquired or viewed; and (iv) The extent to which the risk to the protected health information has been mitigated.
